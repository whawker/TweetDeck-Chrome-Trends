## Userscript
This is a very unofficial TweetDeck extension to add a Trends column

**N.B.** This is currently only compatible with **Google Chrome** (with [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)) and **Firefox** (with [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)) and only works for **web version of TweetDeck (web.tweetdeck.com)** due to browser security policies

The now defunct Adobe Air version of TweetDeck, used to have a trends column, add I thought it be one of the most useful features of Twitter (except when it gets ruined by obsessive Justin Beiber et al fans). The new, web based version doesn't have this feature, and you can only add a search column for a specific (worldwide) trending topic.

This is a super unofficial, pretty dirty hack to add this functionality back in.

## Features

1. Show trending topics for **any region** offered on the main Twitter site and tailored trends!
2. Show news relating to the trending topic
3. Get news relating to trends in your language
4. Ignore trending hashtags
5. Filter trending topics using the built in Global Filter
6. Add as many Trends columns as you like! Using the already built in 'Add column' functionality
